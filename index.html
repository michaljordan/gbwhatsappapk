    <h2>What is GB WhatsApp?</h2>
    <p>GB WhatsApp is a modified version of the original WhatsApp application, developed by independent developers to provide additional features and customization options not available in the official WhatsApp. It retains the core functionality of WhatsApp while introducing various enhancements to improve user experience.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of GB WhatsApp</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Customization Options:</strong> GB WhatsApp offers extensive customization options, allowing users to personalize their interface with custom themes, fonts, and colors. From changing chat backgrounds to customizing the appearance of chat bubbles, users have full control over the visual aesthetics of their messaging app.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Privacy Settings:</strong> Privacy is a top priority for GB WhatsApp users. With GB WhatsApp, you can hide your online status, blue ticks, and even your typing status, providing greater control over your privacy settings. Additionally, GB WhatsApp offers the option to lock individual chats or the entire app with a PIN or fingerprint lock for added security.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Media Sharing:</strong> GB WhatsApp allows users to share larger files and media without compromising on quality. With increased file size limits for photos, videos, and documents, users can exchange high-quality media effortlessly. Moreover, GB WhatsApp enables users to send uncompressed images and videos without compression, ensuring superior image and video quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Dual WhatsApp Accounts:</strong> One of the most sought-after features of GB WhatsApp is its ability to run dual WhatsApp accounts on the same device. This feature is particularly useful for users who wish to maintain separate personal and professional accounts without the need for multiple devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Message Scheduling and Auto-Reply:</strong> GB WhatsApp offers convenient features such as message scheduling and auto-reply, allowing users to schedule messages to be sent at a later time or automatically respond to incoming messages when they are unavailable. This feature is ideal for busy professionals or individuals managing multiple conversations simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
